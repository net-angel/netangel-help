1. Begin by logging in to your Actiontec router by typing "192.168.254.254" into any web browser. 
2. You will be prompted to log in. Typically the default username is "admin". Both the username and password can be found on the side/bottom of the router. Be sure to use the "Admin Password" and not the password used to log on to your WiFi. 
3. Once logged in, click "Advanced Settings" along the top. It's going to ask you to verify you are an "Advanced User" - so congratulations! You are now an Advanced User. Click "Proceed". 
4. In the left-hand column, find the section titled "IP Address", and click "WAN IP Addressing". 
5. Scroll down and find "5. Select the DNS Type". Click "Static DNS Addresses". 
6. Enter the NetAngel DNS Address into the available fields:

54.70.46.42

54.70.76.29

54.70.99.57

7. You are now protected! You can test the filter by going to filtertest.netangel.com
