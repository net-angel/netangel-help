Some Android users have encountered a problem with syncing Google Photos over WiFi while using NetAngel.



Unfortunately, this is an issue with Google. Any VPN (Virtual Private Network) being used on an Android device is susceptible to this problem. For now, we suggest temproarily disabling the NetAngel App while you back up your Photos, then resume protection once you've completed the back up.
