The answer is NO - Incognito Mode (or "Private Browsing") does not work when NetAngel is properly installed. All internet activity, regardless of the browser, if the history is cleared, etc. will be recorded on the NetAngel Dashboard. 



You can view device history by logging into your account and going to dashboard.netangel.com . Select a device, and you will be able to see all internet activity for that device.
