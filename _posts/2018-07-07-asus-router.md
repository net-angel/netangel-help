## Note

Before changing the DNS settings on your router, make sure you have created a DNS device on the NetAngel Dashboard with the public IP address of your network.

## WAN Settings

1. Open a web browser and type in 192.182.1.1 or 192.168.0.1 and hit "Enter".
2. Enter the administrator username and password (this can typically be found on the back of your router).
3. Under "Advanced Settings" on the left-hand side, find and click "WAN".
