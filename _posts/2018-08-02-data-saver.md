Many devices have a "Data Saver" feature to prevent apps from using data in the background. This is handy for people with small data packages, when you're roaming, etc. 



However, using the Data Saver feature interrupts the NetAngel App from properly functioning.  Using this feature on the device means NetAngel cannot properly filter the traffic, which may cause you to receive many text alerts for proxy filter avoidance. 



If you are receiving multiple text alerts when a device is accessing the internet, you may need to turn off your Data Saver feature. Chrome and Android both have their own data saver, and both need to be turned off. 



Turn off Data Saver in Chrome: 



On your Android phone or tablet, open the Chrome app Chrome.

To the right of the address bar, tap More Moreand thenSettings.

Under "Advanced," tap Data Saver.

Switch the setting "OFF".



Turn off Data Saver in Android:

1. On your Android phone or tablet, open the "Settings" app.

2. Find and select "Data Usage".

3. Tap "Data Saver" and turn "OFF".
