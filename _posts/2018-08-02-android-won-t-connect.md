Have you followed the instructions on how to install NetAngel on your Android device, only to find that it refuses to connect to NetAngel? You may have a preconfigured setting on your device called "WiFi Assistant" that is preventing you from connecting. Follow these steps to disable the WiFi Assistant:



1. Go to Android Settings > WiFi > Settings (the gear in the top-right in the corner)



2. Slide the switch for "Use Open WiFi Automatically" to the OFF position.



3. Go back to the main Android Settings > Wireless & Network > More > VPN

\*this may vary depending on the type of device you have. Find the setting that says "VPN"



4. Select "Settings" (or the gear in the top-right corner). Any VPN that is not NetAngel, click the gear and select "Forget VPN".



5. Open the NetAngel app and try connecting again. 



\*If you continue experiencing problems, please contact us.
