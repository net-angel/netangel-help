**Enabling SMS Texts & Call Monitoring**



Begin by logging in to your NetAngel dashboard (dashboard.netangel.com) and selecting the device you wish to view.

 

Along the top, find and click the tab labeled "Calls & SMS". You will see two options: 

\- Enable call and SMS text/picture monitoring

\- Send a monitoring warning to each SMS receipient that the conversation is being monitored

 

Under "Call Blocking" you can choose to block all phone calls except from allowed numbers, if desired. 

 

We suggest you include your accountability partner/parent/spouse on the "Always Allowed" option. You may also block specific phone numbers if you have a problematic number. This prevents the user from calling/receiving phone calls from the number.
