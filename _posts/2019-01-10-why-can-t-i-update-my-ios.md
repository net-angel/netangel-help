In order to allow your iPhones and iPads to perform an iOS software update, you will need to disable NetAngel on the devices first. 

To remove NetAngel, follow these steps:

1. Find and click the "Settings" icon

2. Scroll down and click "General"

3. Scroll down and click "Profile"

4. Select the profile, then click "Remove Profile"

5. Your phone will ask for a removal password. This can be found on your[ NetAngel Dashboard](dashboard.netangel.com). Find and select the device on your dashboard, and click "Manage Device". 

6. Once you've removed NetAngel from the device, you can perform the update. Once completed, re-install NetAngel by going to your [NetAngel Dashboard](dashboard.netangel.com) , find and select the device, click "Manage Device", and "Install Filter".
