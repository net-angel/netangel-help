Begin by logging in to your NetAngel dashboard (dashboard.netangel.com) and selecting which device you wish to edit. 



Along the top, find and select the tab labeled "Lock Device". You will see three options: 

\- Lock Mobile Data, which allows you to prevent the device from using 4G/LTE and only have Internet access when using WiFi.    

\- Lock Internet, which prevents the user from accessing any Internet whatsoever from the device.

\- Lock Device, which locks the entire device except for "Allowed" phone numbers to make and accept phone calls.
