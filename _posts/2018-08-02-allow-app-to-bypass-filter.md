To allow a specific app to bypass the filter do the following.  Please note you should only do this for apps that you trust to not access inappropriate material.  You should also ensure that the app does not have a built in browser which will allow the user to browse the internet. 

1. Find the app in the Applications rules list and click on the gear icon for additional app options.
