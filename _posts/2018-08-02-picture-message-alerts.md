NetAngel comes with the option to alert you when a device you are monitoring receives a picture message. The default is set to "ON". You can edit this feature by turning it ON or OFF at your discretion. Edit this setting by logging in to your NetAngel App and select "Calls and SMS Text Message Monitoring".
