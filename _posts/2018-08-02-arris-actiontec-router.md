1. Begin by logging in to your Arris router by typing "192.168.100.1" into any web browser. 
2. You will be prompted to log in. Typically the default username is "admin". Both the username and password can be found on the side/bottom of the router. Be sure to use the "Admin Password" and not the password used to log on to your WiFi. 
3. Across the top, find and click the "BASIC" tab, then click "Setup".
4. Find the section labled "WAN Connection Settings" and select "Use these DNS servers". 
5. Enter the NetAngel DNS Address into the fields:

54.70.46.42

54.70.76.29

54.70.99.57

6. You are now protected! You can test the filter by going to filtertest.netangel.com
