# If you have a modem router combo 

(only one device)

You will need the MikroTik Audiance.  You should also work with your internet service provider to disable the WIFI on your modem to ensure that devices do not connect directly the modem bypassing the filter.

# If you have a separate modem and router

You can install the MikroTik mAP between the modem and router.  (the MikroTik mAP does not provide WIFI)
