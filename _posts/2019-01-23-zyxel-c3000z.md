1. First, add a device to your [NetAngel Dashboard](dashboard.netangel.com) by logging in and clicking "Add Device" > "Home Router" > "Use your own". Name the device, set the "Type" as "router", and click "ADD". 

2. Login to your Actiontec router by typing 192.168.0.1 into a web browser and hit "enter".

3. Login to your router. The username is typically "admin", and the password can be found on the side/bottom of your Actiontec router. 

4. Once logged in, click "Advanced Setup".

7. Allow your router a few minutes to apply the new settings. Then you can test the filter by going to [filtertest.netangel.com](filtertest.netangel.com) - the page should be blocked if the filter is working properly. 

8. If the page isn't blocked, login to your [NetAngel Dashboard.](dashboard.netangel.com) Select your router, click "Manage Device", and make sure the IP addresses match. If not, click "Use this". Then try again.
