Setting up Application Controls



Begin by logging in to your NetAngel dashboard (dashboard.netangel.com) and selecting which device you wish to view.. 



Along the top, find and select the tab "Application Rules". This lists all the Applications installed on the device.



You will see the option "Block Newly Installed Applications". This enables the user to install new Applications, however, they will automatically be blocked until the administrator "Allows" it on the dashboard. 



You can easily find for an Application by using the "Search" feature. 



When you select an Application, you will see five options:

\- Allow Application           - Hide from history       - Alert me

\- Block Application           - Record usage



There are additional Advanced Settings you can edit by clicking the gear icon to the right. You will see two settings:

\- Application Access: This refers to access to the application itself.

\- Internet Access: Here, you can control whether or not the Application has access to the Internet. *Be aware that allowing Internet Access to an Application with its own web browser could allow the user to browse the Internet. You can set tracking history, and include/exclude the Application from Time Locks.
