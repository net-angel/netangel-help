**How to Edit Filter Settings**

Select your Android device, which will load the Android Device View. Under the "Activity" tab, you can see:

\- Your filter settings. NetAngel automatically defaults to show you Applications, SMS text messages, and phone calls. You can edit these as you wish. 

\- To view specific activity details, select an Application (Chrome, Mail, Calls, etc.)

\- If you wish to edit a particular internet protection setting, select your web browser. (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) If you see an alert for "Gambling", and that is a category you are concerend about, you can select the gear icon. Under "Categories" you can then change it from "allowed" to "blocked". To the right, you can edit your settings: exclude this site from the web history completely; allow the web page but track history; or notify you when this page is accessed. You will also see settings for the actual domain (for example, gambling.com). You can choose to allow this website, or completely block it, as well as adjust your visibility settings for this particular domain. 

**Blocking/Allowing Applications**

You can choose which Applications you want to block or allow on a particular device. Begin by clicking which device you want to edit.

Under the "Activity" tab, select the gear icon to the right of the Appliction you wish to edit. 

You will be given the option to allow or block the Application, as well as your visibility option (exclude this application from your history, include it in your history, or to alert you each time the application is used). You can also allow or exclude an Application from using the internet. 

You can also choose to exclude an Application from your history. 

**Block/Allow Phone Calls**

NetAngel allows you to prevent a particular phone number from calling your phone and vice versa. Under the "Activity" tab, find the phone number in your history, and select either the check mark to always allow the number, or the "x" to completely block the number. 

**Monitoring SMS Text Messages**

Under the "Activity" tab, you can view text messages by clicking the arrow and expanding the activity.
