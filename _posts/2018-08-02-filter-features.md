**YouTube and SafeSearch Options
**



Select which device you want to edit. Along the top, find and select "Web Filter".



 Directly under the "Web Filter" tab, you will see three filtering options:

\- Enforce SafeSearch on Google and Bing

\- Block other search engines (Yahoo, etc.)

\- YouTube Restricted/Blocked Mode



With YouTube Restricted Mode, you can select four filtering options: Off, Moderate filtering, Restricted, or Blocked. "Blocked" mode prevents the user from accessing YouTube (see below image).

**Editing Filter Categories
**



For each category, you will see five options:

\- Allow Access          - Don't record useage history      - Alert me

\- Block Access          - Record Usage History



**URL Exceptions
**



Along the top, find and select the "URL Exceptions" Tab.



This allows you to edit specific websites outside of the category settings. You can also block any specific websites you wish in this setting. Be sure to click the "x" (do not allow). You can remove exceptions by clicking the "x" on the right-hand side.

\*Note: When blocking websites, it is best to leave out "www." This ensures the mobile version of the website will also be blocked. For example: block "facebook.com" instead of "www.facebook.com".
